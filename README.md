# Image Colorization using CNN and Autoencoders
## Project for Game Theory course at University of Padova.

**Authors**: Lucia Depaoli, Simone Mistrali

**Project Summary**: Automatic b\&w image colorization using CNN architecture and autoencoder. Solution implemeted both in Pytorch and Keras. We apply models on two different datasets.

**Abstract**: Image colorization is one of the most challenging task in
computer vision of the last years, due to its multimodal nature.
Since most of the objects can assume a wide spectrum
of different colors, the smarter way to deal with the problem
is not by looking at the ground truth color distribution
of the image, but to find a plausible one. In this project we
will tackle this task via CNN and via an autoencoder network
architecture, inspired by previous works. We will try
to give an explanation of the problems we will face, and we
will perform several experiments in order to understand the
complexity of the task.
